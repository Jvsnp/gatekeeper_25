Cleanup
Remember to correct the paths and group names in your cleanup commands as well:

Bash

sudo rm -rf /opt/secure_project # Corrected directory name
sudo userdel -r admin_user
sudo userdel -r developer_user # Don't forget to delete this user too
sudo userdel -r auditor_user
sudo groupdel project_admins   # Corrected group name
sudo groupdel project_developers # Don't forget this group
sudo groupdel project_auditors   # Corrected group name
